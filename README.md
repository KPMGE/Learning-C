# Learning-C

## Goal

This repository holds my programs with the C programming language. Here you'll find a bunch of programs
from the simpler until the hardest ones. Gradually, I intent to add more and more programs in order to learn more about such a beautiful programming language.
So, this repository is mainly focused on basic concepts of C, if you're looking for something like Data Structures, I
have another repository focused on that purpose. Feel free to jump to it if sounds interesting: [Learning Data StructuresC](https://github.com/KPMGE/Learning-DataStructures-C).
Finally, feel free to check and copy any of these programs. I honestly hope it helps! :wink:
